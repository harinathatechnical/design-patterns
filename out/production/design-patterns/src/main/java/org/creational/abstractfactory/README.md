## 🏭 Abstract Factory Pattern

The **Abstract Factory Pattern** is one of the **Creational Design Patterns** and is very similar to the **Factory Pattern** — except that it acts more like a **factory of factories**.

---

### 📌 What is it?

If you are familiar with the **Factory Design Pattern** in Java, you know that you typically have a single factory class that returns different subclasses based on the input provided. This is usually done using `if-else` or `switch` statements inside the factory.

In the **Abstract Factory Pattern**, we eliminate the `if-else` block by having **a separate factory class for each family of subclasses**. Then, we use an **Abstract Factory** that returns the appropriate factory class based on the input.

At first glance, this may seem confusing — but once you see the implementation, it’s easy to understand the **minor difference** between the Factory and Abstract Factory Patterns.

### ✅ Key Benefits

- 🚀 Provides a higher level of abstraction than the Factory Pattern.
- 🔧 Helps manage families of related or dependent objects.
- ⚡ Makes adding new product families easier without modifying existing code.

### 📖 Example Structure

Here’s the typical structure:

```java
// Abstract Factory
public interface ComputerFactory {
    Computer createComputer();
}

// Concrete Factory 1
public class PCFactory implements ComputerFactory {
    public Computer createComputer() {
        return new PC();
    }
}

// Concrete Factory 2
public class ServerFactory implements ComputerFactory {
    public Computer createComputer() {
        return new Server();
    }
}

// Superclass
public interface Computer {
    String getType();
}

// Subclass 1
public class PC implements Computer {
    public String getType() {
        return "PC";
    }
}

// Subclass 2
public class Server implements Computer {
    public String getType() {
        return "Server";
    }
}

// Client code
public class AbstractFactoryPatternDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ComputerFactory factory = new PCFactory();
        Computer pc = factory.createComputer();
        System.out.println(pc.getType());

        factory = new ServerFactory();
        Computer server = factory.createComputer();
        System.out.println(server.getType());
    }
}
```

🔑 Difference from Factory Pattern
---

### 🔍 Factory Pattern vs Abstract Factory Pattern

| Factory Pattern | Abstract Factory Pattern |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| ✅ Single factory class with `if-else` logic | ✅ Multiple factory classes managed by an abstract factory |
| 🎯 Good for creating **one type of product** | 🎯 Good for creating **families of related products** |
| ⚠️ Less flexible for families | 🚀 More flexible and scalable |

## ✅ Benefits of Abstract Factory Pattern

- 💡 **Code to Interface:**  
  The Abstract Factory Pattern promotes coding to an **interface** rather than a concrete implementation.

- 🏭 **Factory of Factories:**  
  The Abstract Factory Pattern acts as a **factory of factories** and can be easily extended to accommodate more products.  
  For example, you can add another subclass like `Laptop` and create a `LaptopFactory` without changing existing code.

- 🚫 **No Conditional Logic:**  
  The Abstract Factory Pattern is robust and helps **avoid the `if-else` or `switch` statements** used in the simple Factory Pattern.

## 📌 Abstract Factory Pattern Examples in JDK

Here are some examples of the Abstract Factory Pattern in the Java Standard Library:

- `javax.xml.parsers.DocumentBuilderFactory#newInstance()`
- `javax.xml.transform.TransformerFactory#newInstance()`
- `javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory#newInstance()`

These APIs abstract away complex instantiation details and provide families of related objects using the Abstract Factory Pattern.
